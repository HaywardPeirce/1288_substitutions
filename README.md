# 1288_substitutions
A Google Chrome extension for substituting words in webpages. Inspired by [XKCD comic 1288](https://xkcd.com/1288/)

### TODO
- Re-do substitutions when content on the page is reloaded
- Include nested elements to be substituted
- Create a form for user to include their own words to substitute
- parse current page URL and list of stored domains before comparing them
- Domain management so user can select which domains to include/exclude from the script being run on
  - maybe include pre-set options to select from
  - Form for people to add in additional entries

### Dependancies
- jquery 3.3.1
- bootstrap 3.3.7

download both dependancies and place them in a folder called `/scripts`
